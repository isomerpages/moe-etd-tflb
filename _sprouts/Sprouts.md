<center>Busy but passionate teachers need more effective ways to inculcate values in students as they struggle to find time beyond the classroom to affirm their students’ values-learning.&nbsp;
<br><br>	
Willing parents who find it awkward to talk about values in abstraction need help to get values-based conversations going as they face difficulties in keeping them open and engaging, while disinterested parents need to be enticed to have such conversations with their children.</center>

<center><h2 id="innovation">Our Innovation</h2></center>
<center>Sprouts is a platform that <b>enhances the child’s values-learning</b>. It does so by enabling adults and children to hold values-based conversations together, beyond the classroom. Through Sprouts, we (the adults) can also <b>gain a better understanding of a child’s concept of values</b> and how much they have learnt.</center>
