Choose-your-own-adventure immersive learning experience toolkit (CYOA-ILT) is a lesson design toolkit. It provides teachers with scaffolds for crafting stories that immerse students in first-person narratives.
  
Through these narratives, students are able to make active decisions related to real-world issues. Depending on these decisions, students will experience the consequences of their choice through different outcomes. We hope this will inspire curiosity and develop studentsâ€™ ability to appreciate multiple perspectives towards complex, multifaceted issues.
