<p>CotF <em>(with inputs from CPDD1 and 2, as well as AST)</em> has developed
curriculum-aligned sample lesson templates recommending the use of SLS
AI-enabled features for issues in Science (Secondary) and English argumentative
writing.</p>
<p>Lessons developed using these templates allow for timely, individualised,
and actionable feedback that promotes deeper learning for Critical, Adaptive
and Inventive Thinking development.</p>
