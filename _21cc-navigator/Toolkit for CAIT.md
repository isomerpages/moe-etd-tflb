<center><p>To support development of Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking (CAIT)
through learning activities in Secondary Science and Secondary English
Language, CotF has worked with AST and CPDD to develop sample SLS lesson
flows, in the form of templates, with recommended use of the SLS AI-enabled
feature ShortAnsFA for engagement in issues in Science and argumentative
writing in English.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These provide a starting point for teachers to incorporate and apply strategies
to help students enhance their metacognition, problem-solving skills and
critical thinking through developing self-awareness, monitoring and evaluation
of their thinking.</p>
