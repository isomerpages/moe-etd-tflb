<p>These resources are sample SLS lesson templates that include suggested
lesson activities and SLS AI features (i.e., ShortAnsFA [rubrics]) to help
develop 21CC, particularly aspects of Critical, Adaptive and Inventive
Thinking, for Issues in Science (Secondary) and English Argumentative Writing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These lesson templates are accompanied with a user guide as well as rubrics
templates that serve as a list of non-exhaustive criteria and band descriptors
that you can input into the ShortAnsFA (rubrics).</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can customise and edit the lesson templates and rubrics according
to your needs. You can also choose to use these in class or assign them
as self-study work to promote self-directedness in studentsâ€™ refinement
of their learning.</p>
