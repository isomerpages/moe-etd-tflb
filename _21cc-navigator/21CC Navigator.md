<center><p>Passionate but pragmatic secondary school teachers want to help students
see the value of going beyond academic results to develop future-ready
skills.
<br>
<br>Secondary school students simply follow what their teachers say, and do
not see a link between what they learn in school and how it will help them
in the future.</p>

the transformative potential of technology to empower development of students’
21st Century Competencies (21CC).</p>

<center><p>21CC Navigator is a learning package on SLS that comprises 6 E21CC Quests*
and a Welcome Guide to support teachers in kickstarting the development
of E21CC. Assign it to your students as home-based learning or complete
the quests in class to help raise students' awareness of the E21CC.
