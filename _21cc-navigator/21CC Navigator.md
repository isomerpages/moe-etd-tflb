<center><p>Passionate but pragmatic secondary school teachers want to help students
see the value of going beyond academic results to develop future-ready
skills.
<br>
<br>Secondary school students simply follow what their teachers say, and do
not see a link between what they learn in school and how it will help them
in the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>MOE has identified <a href="[https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/21st-century-competencies](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/21st-century-competencies)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="\_blank">a list of competencies</a> that are essential for our students to develop to prepare them for the future, and seeks to harness
the transformative potential of technology to empower development of students’ emerging
21st Century Competencies (E21CC).</p>

<center><p>21CC Navigator is a set of resources for schools to develop Emerging 21st Century Competencies (E21CC) through SLS. We have a <a href="/e21cc-quests/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="\_blank">learning package</a> to raise students' awareness of the E21CC  and a <a href="/e21cc-quests/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="\_blank"> toolkit</a> to develop Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking (CAIT) through the Total Curriculum.
