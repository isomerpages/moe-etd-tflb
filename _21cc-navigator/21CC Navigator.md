<center><p>Secondary school students need a better way to work on their areas of doubt during self-study, and notice connections between what they learn in school and how it will help them in the future.</p>
 
<p>Secondary school teachers want to support students' independence in self-monitoring and assessment in learning, and help students see the value of going beyond academic results to develop future-ready skills.</p>
 
<p>In addition, MOE has identified <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/21st-century-competencies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="\_blank">21st Century Competencies</a> that are essential for our students to develop to prepare them for the future.

<p>We have an <a href="/e21cc-quests/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="\_blank">SLS learning package</a> to raise students' awareness of the E21CC  and a <a href="/21ccn-resources/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="\_blank"> toolkit</a> to develop Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking (CAIT) through SLS. You can also search for SLS Modules with E21CC tags to develop E21CC through subject content.
