| The non-verbal student who struggles to express herself.|The anxious student&nbsp;who has trouble understanding text.|The fearful student who does not want to make mistakes in front of the class.|The quiet boy who has difficulties with reading and writing.|

We have something for you! This resource guide aims to shine a spotlight on eliciting studentsâ€™ voices in classes with diverse learning needs.&nbsp;

With the use of these SLS features, we hope to help you support your students with diverse learning needs (e.g. literacy difficulties, challenges in expression) , enable them to participate more actively in class, and build their self-confidence.
