<center><h2>Our Discovery</h2></center>

<center><p>Passionate but pragmatic secondary school teachers want to help students
see the value of going beyond academic results to develop future-ready
skills.
<br>
<br>Secondary school students simply follow what their teachers say, and do
not see a link between what they learn in school and how it will help them
in the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>MOE has identified a list of competencies* that are essential for our
students to develop to prepare them for the future, and seeks to harness
the transformative potential of technology to empower development of students’
21st Century Competencies* (21CC).</p>
<p></p>

<center><h2>Our Innovation</h2></center>
<p>21CC Navigator is a learning package on SLS that comprises a [undefined](/e21cc-quests/)6 E21CC Quests*
and a Welcome Guide to support teachers in kickstarting the development
of E21CC. Assign it to your students as home-based learning or complete
the quests in class to help raise students' awareness of the E21CC.
<br>
</p>
<p>*E21CC Quests are SLS lessons that include lesson activities and interactives
to help your students learn about the E21CC. Students get to engage in
games and interactives and collect gems as they complete these lessons.
