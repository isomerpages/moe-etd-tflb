<center>A series of resources to help you support your students with diverse learning needs.</center>

<center><h3>The Pain Point</h3></center>
<center>Primary school students are usually enthusiastic to share their views and feelings in class. Often, only a few students are chosen. On the other hand, there is also a group of students who are not confident and comfortable to share in class. Consequently, teachers are unable to understand every student's thoughts and some students stop sharing after repeated disappointments.

How might we allow students to feel confident and comfortable to have a voice in class and at the same time helping teachers to reach out to them in an efficient and timely manner?</center>

<center><h3>The Solution</h3></center>
<center>The <b>Eliciting Voices of Students with Diverse Learning Needs (EVS) resources</b> aims to shine a spotlight on eliciting studentsâ€™ voices in classes with diverse learning needs.

With the use of these resources, we hope to help teachers support students with diverse learning needs (e.g. literacy difficulties, challenges in expression), enable them to participate more actively in class, and build their self-confidence.</center>
