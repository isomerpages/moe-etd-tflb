  Resource Guide featuring SLS"

## Do you have these students in your class?

*   The non-verbal student who struggles to express herself.
    
*   The anxious student who has trouble understanding text. 
    
*   The fearful student who does not want to make mistakes in front of the class. 
    
*   The quiet boy who has difficulties with reading and writing. 

We have something for you! This resource guide aims to shine a spotlight on eliciting students’ voices in classes with diverse learning needs. 

With the use of these SLS features, we hope to help you support your students with diverse learning needs (e.g. literacy difficulties, challenges in expression) , enable them to participate more actively in class, and build their self-confidence.
