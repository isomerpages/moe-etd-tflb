<center><h2 id="discovery">Our Discovery</h2></center>
<center>Primary school pupils are usually enthusiastic about sharing their views and feelings in class. Often, only a few pupils are chosen. On the other hand, there is also a group of pupils also need more confidence and comfort to share in class. Consequently, teachers are unable to understand every pupil's thoughts, and some pupils stop sharing after repeated disappointments.</center>

-----------------

<center><h2 id="innovation">Our Innovation</h2></center>
<center>The <b>Eliciting Voices of Students with Diverse Learning Needs (EVS)</b> is a series of resources co-designed with the Psychological Services Branch (PSB).</center>
<center>With the use of these resources, we hope to help teachers support students with diverse learning needs (e.g. literacy difficulties, challenges in expression), enable them to participate more actively in class, and build their self-confidence.</center>
