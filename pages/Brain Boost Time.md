<center><h2 id="discovery">Our Discovery</h2></center>
<center>Concerned and caring teachers, who notice that their students can be overly energetic or are particularly lethargic at different times of the day, need a way to regulate their students’ energy levels so that they are able to focus better.</center>

-----------------

<center><h2 id="innovation">Our Innovation</h2></center>
<center><b>Brain Boost Time (BBT)</b> is a tool for primary school teachers to use in class to get their pupils to the optimal zone of learning, especially when the pupils are clearly lethargic or extra fidgety. Brain Boost Time offers physical, cognitive, and affective break-time activities such as: </center>
<ul>
<li>Physical Energisers (with fast, slow, or mixed speeds) through animated 3D models of animals with evidence-based aerobic or coordinative actions</li>
<li>Brain Teasers with simple thinking activities</li>
<li>Curated videos and audio for mindfulness</li>
</ul>

<center><h2 id="impact">Our Impact</h2></center>

<center>We noticed that after using BBT, quieter students (silent sufferers included) were more responsive and participative and students who were usually disruptive or distracted were on task for longer and were evidently less fidgety too.

The 5 positive changes we noticed in students during our observations include:</center>
<ul>
	<li>Less fidgeting and disruptions (or longer time-on-task)</li>
	<li>Fewer heads on the table or propped up on hands</li>
	<li>Faster response time from students</li>
	<li>More participative in class discussions</li>
	<li>Increased engagement and enjoyment in the learning process</li>
</ul>

<center>Rated an average of <b>4.1 out of 5 stars</b> by teachers during Teacher's Conference and ExCEL Festival (TCEF) 2021 for potential usefulness in managing students’ energy level during a lesson.</center>

<center><blockquote><i>"BBT definitely makes lessons more interesting. Makes pupils more alive. After using BBT, they are more responsive and more at ease. I noticed that difference. In terms of quality of work and focus, I can see that they are more keen to do the work after." - Primary 5 Teacher</i></blockquote></center>

<center><blockquote><i>"When I use BBT, the process is smooth, the resources are ready, and I don’t need to prepare, which is good. As I use BBT over time, it becomes like a routine and more students participate." - Primary 4/5 Teacher</i></blockquote></center>
