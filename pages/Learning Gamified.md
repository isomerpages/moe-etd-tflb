<center>Learning Gamified has collaborated with the Student Learning Space (SLS) team to enable the gamification of learning in the platform. In SLS, teachers can introduce game-based elements to be introduced in an SLS Course. Some of the game-based elements include <b>Experience Points (XP), Levels, Game Stories, Achievements, Leaderboard</b>, and more!</center>
