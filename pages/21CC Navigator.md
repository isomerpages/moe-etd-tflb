<h2>Our Discovery</h2>
<p>Passionate but pragmatic secondary school teachers want to help students
see the value of going beyond academic results to develop future-ready
skills.
<br>
<br>Secondary school students simply follow what their teachers say, and do
not see a link between what they learn in school and how it will help them
in the future.</p>

<h2>Our Impact</h2>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students reported a <strong>greater awareness of 21CC</strong> and were <strong>motivated</strong> to
learn more about 21CC and hone their future-ready skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students shared that the use of 21CC Navigator enabled <strong>organic social interaction and support</strong> between
teacher-student, student-student, and student-family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While teachers took time to incorporate 21CC Navigator into their teaching
practices, they observed that their students were better able to understand
how their school work and activities <strong>related to their 21CC development</strong>.</p>
