<center><h2 id="discovery">Our Discovery</h2></center>
<center>Curious yet busy secondary school students need a safe space to discover, explore and share their interests beyond the curriculum but are unsure where to begin and struggle to sustain these interests.</center>

-----------------

<center><h2 id="innovation">Our Innovation</h2></center>
<center><b>InteresThing</b> is a suite of tools to help students discover, explore, and share about their interests within or beyond the curriculum for Student-Initiated learning (SIL).</center>

<center><h3>Step 1: Discover</h3></center>
<center>Initiate your students’ SIL journey with the Interest Discovery Quiz, which provides interest recommendations.</center>

<center><h3>Step 2: Explore</h3></center>
<center>Students can then delve into a curated list of learning experiences and resources for students as starting points for their SIL.</center>
