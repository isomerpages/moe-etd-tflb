<h2>How might we help students to develop self-regulation for practical work?</h2>

<h2>Our Discovery</h2>
<p>Students want to conduct practical tasks on their own, but struggle to self-regulate and as a result, continue to be reliant on their teachers for continual guidance.
<br>
<br>Teachers find it difficult to prioritise their attention as students are working individually, progressing at different pace during the lessons.</p>

<h2>Our Innovation</h2>
<p><strong>Toolkit for Practical Lessons</strong> includes <strong> a user guide </strong> and some <strong>sample SLS Practical Based Lessons </strong> for the following subjects:</p>

<p>a) Biology</p>
<p>b) Chemistry</p>
<p>c) Food and Nutrition</p>

With the use of these resources, we hope to help teachers support students in a practical lesson and preparing students to be self-regulated learners.

<h2>Our Impact</h2>

<span style="font-size: 20px;color:#FF0082">Hear what our Science teacher users have to say...</span>

<center><blockquote><i>"There is less of ‘how to do’, ‘is it correct’ types of questions. We can <b>divert our time to those who really need help and attention.</b>” </i></blockquote></center>

<center><blockquote><i>"They can <b>on the spot do some edits</b> to figure out. (The current challenge is that) students <b>forgot about what they have done last week </b>, why their answer do not match the expected observation” </i></blockquote></center>

<center><blockquote><i>“(The feedback) gave me a <b> gauge on whether I did the experiment correctly</b>, so if I did something wrong, I can refer and redo the experiment”</i></blockquote></center>
