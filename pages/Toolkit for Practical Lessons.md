<h2>How might we help students to develop self-regulation for practical work?</h2>

<h2>Our Discovery</h2>
<p>Students want to conduct practical tasks on their own, but struggle to self-regulate and as a result, continue to be reliant on their teachers for continual guidance.
<br>
<br>Teachers find it difficult to prioritise their attention as students are working individually, progressing at different pace during the lessons.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Our Innovation</h2>
<p><strong>Toolkit for Practical Lessons</strong> includes <strong> a user guide </strong> and some <strong>sample SLS Practical Based Lessons </strong> for the following subjects:</p>

<p>a) Biology</p>
<p>b) Chemistry</p>
<p>c) Food and Nutrition</p>
With the use of these resources, we hope to help teachers support students in a practical lesson and preparing students to be self-regulated learners.

**Assess the guide to find out more about how to utilise the sample templates and structure your practical lesson with SLS**

1.  Biology
2.  Chemistry
3.  Food and Nutrition

<h2>Our Impact</h2>
<p><strong> Hear what Science teachers says:</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“There is less of ‘how to do’, ‘is it correct’ types of questions.”

“We can divert our time to those who really need help and attention.” </em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"They can on the spot do some edit to figure out. (The current challenge is that) students;forgot about what they have done last week, why their answer do not match the expected observation” </em></p>
</blockquote>

	
<p><strong> Science Student Quotes:</strong></p>
<blockquote>

<p><em>“(The feedback) gave me a gauge on whether I did the experiment correctly, so if I did something wrong, I can refer and redo the experiment”</em></p>
</blockquote>
	
<p><strong> NFS Teacher Quotes:</strong>
</p>

<blockquote>
	
“During the practical lesson, self-assessment skills is something that we want to instill in the students, and also information for us, whether they are comfortable.”
<p></p>
	</blockquote>

<p><strong> NFS Student Quotes:</strong></p>
