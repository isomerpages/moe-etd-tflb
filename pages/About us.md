The Classroom of the Future (CotF) is an Educational Technology Division, Information Technology Division, and Government Technology Agency effort where different government agencies leverage design thinking and other human-centric methodologies to **redesign the teaching and learning experience for students and teachers** to meet current and future needs. 

CotF solutions enhance teaching and learning to help students to be future-ready, preparing them for an increasingly complex, interconnected, and tech-driven world.

The core of CotF is represented by our tagline - redesigning learning. 

CotF's use of design thinking and human centric methodologies allows us a unique lens and insight into the teaching and learning space, enabling us opportunities to better support our teachers, students, and schools in their teaching and learning experiences. Thus, CotF is redesigning learning by:
* Identifying challenges, framing, and prioritising opportunities in the technology-enabled classroom.
* Generating, prototyping, and testing potential digital or non-digital solutions for the delivery of effective teaching and learning experiences.
* Developing capabilities within MOE in the design, deployment, and scaling of technologies and solutions for teaching & learning.
