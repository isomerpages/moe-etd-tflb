<center><h2 id="discovery">Our Discovery</h2></center>

<center>Teachers find it time-consuming, tedious and sometimes uninspiring to search for relevant and good resources for lesson planning, teaching or assessment. They have to manually search for links and resources from different locations (e.g. websites, past year papers, guide books etc) until they find suitable resources for their needs.</center>

-----------------

<center><h2 id="innovation">Our Prototype</h2></center>
	
<center><b>Source Finder</b> is a platform that enables teachers to build a community to share, find and organise resources collectively. It is also a productivity tool for individual teachers to organise their resources efficiently.**</center>

<center><h3>Hear what our teacher users have to say about Source Finder!</h3></center>

<center><blockquote><i>"I logged in to Source Finder to look for new sources to craft activities for my students. Beyond interesting articles, I found the curated categories of sources to be much more meaningful. For example - Australia's Mice Plague, and even on the topic of vape. I certainly did not think of these topics immediately, but seeing these topics appear gave me a bunch of other ideas which I am toying with right now." - Secondary Social Studies Teacher</i></blockquote></center>

<center><blockquote><i>"Before using Source Finder, I always thought it would be something complex. However, I felt comfortable using it and navigating the different pages. I think it's quite interesting to have a repository of sources for teachers to use. The sources which I saw seem to be pretty unique and can certainly enhance the classroom practices. I think it's also quite fun to have a user-centric platform which helps to build a learning community." - Secondary School History Teacher</i></blockquote></center>
