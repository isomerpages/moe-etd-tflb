<h2>How might we help students to develop self-regulation for practical work?</h2>

<h2>Our Discovery</h2>
<p>Students want to conduct practical tasks on their own, but struggle to self-regulate and as a result, continue to be reliant on their teachers for guidance.
<br>
<br>Teachers find it difficult to prioritise their attention as students are working individually, progressing at different pace during the lessons.</p>

<h2>Our Innovation</h2>
<p><strong> Supporting Self-Regulated Learning in Practical Lessons</strong> includes <strong> a user guide </strong> and some <strong>sample SLS modules</strong> for Practical Lessons in the following subjects:</p>

<br>
	
With the use of these resources, we hope to help teachers support students in a practical lesson and preparing students to be self-regulated learners.

<h2>Our Impact</h2>

<span style="font-size: 20px;color:#FF0082">Hear what our teachers and students say...</span>

<center><blockquote><i>"There is less of ‘how to do’, ‘is it correct’ types of questions. We can <b>divert our time to those who really need help and attention. </b>” <br> - Secondary Science teacher</i></blockquote></center>

<center><blockquote><i>"They can <b>on the spot do some edits to figure out. </b> (The current challenge is that) students <b>forgot about what they have done last week </b>, why their answer do not match the expected observation” <br> - Secondary Science teacher</i></blockquote></center>

<center><blockquote><i>“(The feedback) gave me a <b> gauge on whether I did the experiment correctly</b>, so if I did something wrong, I can refer and redo the experiment” <br>- Secondary Science student</i></blockquote></center>

<center><blockquote><i>"During the practical lesson, <b>self-assessment skills is something that we want to instill</b> in the students, and also information for us, whether they are comfortable.”<br> - Secondary Nutrition and Food Science teacher</i></blockquote></center>

<center><blockquote><i>"“We could cook at our own pace <b> without missing out on instructions </b> ”<br> - Secondary Nutrition and Food Science student</i></blockquote></center>
