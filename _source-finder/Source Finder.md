<center><blockquote><i>"Beyond interesting articles (in Source Finder), I found the curated categories of sources to be much more meaningful. For example - Australia's Mice Plague, and even on the topic of vape. I certainly did not think of these topics immediately, but seeing these topics appear gave me a bunch of other ideas which I am toying with right now." - Secondary Social Studies Teacher</i></blockquote></center>

<center><blockquote><i>"I always thought it (Source Finder) would be something complex. However, I felt comfortable using it and navigating the different pagesâ€¦ I think it's also quite fun to have a user-centric platform which helps to build a learning community." - Secondary School History Teacher </i></blockquote></center>
