<center><h2 id="discovery">Our Discovery</h2></center>
<center>Teachers sometime struggle to inspire perspectives and concern among students when engaging in discourse that feels disconnected from students' everyday experience. Students may not relate to content that they read in their textbooks and end up feeling bored and disengaged.</center>

-----------------

<center><h2 id="innovation">Our Innovation</h2></center>
<center><b>Choose-your-own-adventure Immersive Learning Toolkit (CYOA-ILT)</b> is a lesson design toolkit. It provides you with scaffolds for crafting stories that immerse students in first-person narratives.</center>
<center>Through these narratives, students are able to make active decisions related to real-world issues. Depending on these decisions, students will experience the consequences of their choice through different outcomes. We hope this will inspire curiosity and develop students’ ability to appreciate multiple perspectives towards complex, multifaceted issues.</center>

<center><h3>Text based Sample</h3></center>

<center>Similar to the old-school books where readers flip to a page number when making a decision for the character in a story. These text based samples mimic the same experience in a digital way without the need to flip through a physical book.
